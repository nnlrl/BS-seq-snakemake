Bismark report for: /home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results/02_trimming/SEsample_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.23.0)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/resources/ with the specified options: -q -N 0 -L 20 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	2014
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	792
Mapping efficiency:	39.3%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	1222
Sequences did not map uniquely:	0
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	350	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	442	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0

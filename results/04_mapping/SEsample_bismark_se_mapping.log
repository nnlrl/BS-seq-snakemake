Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.4.2])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results/.snakemake/conda/00864ad21126c95a72ec24733e4358ee/bin/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is /home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/resources/	(absolute path is '/home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/resources/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results'):
/home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results/02_trimming/SEsample_trimmed.fq.gz
Library is assumed to be strand-specific (directional), alignments to strands complementary to the original top or bottom strands will be ignored (i.e. not performed!)
Output will be written into the directory: /home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results/04_mapping/

Using temp directory: /home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results/04_mapping/
Temporary files will be written into the directory: /home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results/04_mapping/
Summary of all aligner options:	-q -N 0 -L 20 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

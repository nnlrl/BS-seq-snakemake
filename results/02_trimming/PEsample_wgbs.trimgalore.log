Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.1
Could not detect version of Python used by Cutadapt from the first line of Cutadapt (but found this: >>>#!/bin/sh<<<)
Letting the (modified) Cutadapt deal with the Python version instead
pigz 2.6
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 6 cores

Output will be written into the directory: /home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results/02_trimming/


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /home/data/t020329/ngs/new_meth/results/work/input/PEsample_wgbs_1.fq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1413	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1413	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	1413	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 0, count Illumina: 0, count Nextera: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
